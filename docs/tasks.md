# E-Squirell Project Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized checklist of improvement tasks for the E-Squirell project, covering both architectural and code-level improvements.

## Architecture Improvements

1. [x] Implement a proper API versioning strategy (e.g., `/api/v1/`) to ensure backward compatibility as the API evolves
2. [ ] Create a service layer between views and models to encapsulate business logic and make it reusable
3. [ ] Implement a message queue system (like Celery) for handling asynchronous tasks, especially for data processing
4. [ ] Develop a consistent error handling strategy across all API endpoints
5. [ ] Implement a caching strategy for frequently accessed data (e.g., energy prices, recent measurements)
6. [ ] Create a unified logging system across all components (backend, ESP32, MQTT)
7. [ ] Implement a proper dependency injection pattern for better testability
8. [ ] Refactor the ESP32 code to use a more modular architecture with clear separation of concerns

## Security Improvements

9. [ ] Finalize authentication strategy for all API endpoints (resolve the TODO in energy_prices/views.py)
10. [ ] Implement proper authorization checks for all endpoints
11. [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent API abuse
12. [ ] Implement HTTPS for all API communications
13. [ ] Secure the MQTT broker with proper authentication and access control
14. [ ] Add input validation for all API endpoints
15. [ ] Implement secure storage for sensitive configuration (e.g., using environment variables instead of JSON files)
16. [ ] Conduct a security audit of the entire system

## Code Quality Improvements

17. [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings to all classes and methods
18. [ ] Implement consistent code formatting using a tool like Black
19. [ ] Add type hints to all Python code for better IDE support and static analysis
20. [ ] Increase test coverage, especially for the energy_tracker and storage_heater apps
21. [ ] Implement integration tests for the entire system
22. [ ] Add linting with tools like flake8 or pylint
23. [ ] Refactor duplicated code into shared utilities
24. [ ] Implement proper error handling in the ESP32 code beyond just restarting

## Performance Improvements

25. [ ] Optimize database queries, especially for the EnergyLog model which will grow large
26. [ ] Implement database indexes for frequently queried fields
27. [ ] Add pagination to all list API endpoints
28. [ ] Implement filtering and sorting options for API endpoints
29. [ ] Consider time-series database options for storing energy measurements
30. [ ] Optimize the MQTT message format for efficiency
31. [ ] Implement data aggregation for historical energy data to reduce storage requirements

## Documentation Improvements

32. [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation using a tool like Swagger/OpenAPI
33. [ ] Document the system architecture with diagrams
34. [ ] Create setup and installation guides for all components
35. [ ] Document the data models and their relationships
36. [ ] Create user guides for the system
37. [ ] Document the MQTT topics and message formats
38. [ ] Add comments explaining complex algorithms or business logic

## DevOps Improvements

39. [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
40. [ ] Implement proper environment configuration for development, testing, and production
41. [ ] Create comprehensive Docker Compose setup for local development
42. [ ] Implement database migrations strategy for production deployments
43. [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for the production system
44. [ ] Implement backup and recovery procedures
45. [ ] Create deployment documentation

## Feature Improvements

46. [ ] Implement data visualization for energy consumption
47. [ ] Add forecasting capabilities for energy usage and costs
48. [ ] Implement user notification system for important events (e.g., high energy usage)
49. [ ] Add support for multiple energy meters
50. [ ] Implement energy-saving recommendations based on usage patterns
51. [ ] Add support for additional IoT devices beyond storage heaters
52. [ ] Implement a dashboard for system monitoring and control
